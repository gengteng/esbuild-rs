// This parser does two passes:
//
// 1. Parse the source into an AST, create the scope tree, and declare symbols.
//
// 2. Visit each node in the AST, bind identifiers to declared symbols, do
//    constant folding, substitute compile-time variable definitions, and
//    lower certain syntactic constructs as appropriate given the language
//    target.
//
// So many things have been put in so few passes because we want to minimize
// the number of full-tree passes to improve performance. However, we need
// to have at least two separate passes to handle variable hoisting. See the
// comment about scopesInOrder below for more information.
